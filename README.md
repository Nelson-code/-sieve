# -sieve Methods
Prime numbers are fundamental to the most common type of encryption used today. So, the generation of large prime numbers in less time is the main concern in an organization. The Sieve methods plays an important role in generating primes in a short time.
The sieve methods are implemented by
the following algorithms
•	Sieve of Eratosthenes
•	Sieve of Sundaram
•	Sieve of Atkin
